<h1>Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, often following E. coli infection.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostics</strong>: Schistocytes on blood smear, elevated reticulocyte count, and renal failure markers (increased BUN, creatinine).</li>
<li><strong>Treatment</strong>: Supportive care, including dialysis in severe cases, and careful monitoring of kidney function.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Learning Point</strong>: Early recognition of HUS is critical due to the risk of severe renal failure and long-term complications.</p>
