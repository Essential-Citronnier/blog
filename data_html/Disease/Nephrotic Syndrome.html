<h1>Nephrotic Syndrome (신증후군)</h1>
<ul>
<li><strong>Symptoms</strong>: Edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and massive proteinuria.</li>
<li><strong>Diagnostic Features</strong>: Elevated cholesterol levels, reduced albumin, significant protein loss in urine (up to 8,500 mg/24 hr).</li>
<li><strong>Treatment</strong>: Steroids (Prednisolone), monitoring for complications like infections and thrombosis due to hypoalbuminemia.</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>Key Learning Point</strong>: Nephrotic syndrome increases the risk of thromboembolism, especially in children. Avoid aggressive hydration due to the risk of exacerbating edema.</p>
