      "Chronic lymphocytic leukaemia/small lymphocytic lymphoma (CLL/SLL) is a neoplasm composed of monomorphic small, round to slightly irregular B lymphocytes in the peripheral blood (PB), bone marrow (BM), spleen and lymph nodes, admixed with prolymphocytes and paraimmunoblasts forming proliferation centres in tissue infiltrates. The CLL/SLL cells usually coexpress CD5 and CD23. In the absence of extramedullary tissue involvement, there must be <5x109/L monoclonal lymphocytes with a CLL phenotype in the PB. The International Workshop on Chronic Lymphocytic Leukemia (IWCLL) report requires that the lymphocytosis be present for at least 3 months and also allows for the diagnosis of CLL to be made with lower lymphocyte counts in patients with cytopenias or disease-related symptoms. Whether patients who would have fulfilled the criteria in the past for CLL but who fulfill the criteria only for monoclonal B lymphocytosis (MBL) are better considered to have low stage CLL or MBL remains to be determined. Some may prefer to still consider many of these cases more like CLL. The term SLL is used for non-leukaemic cases with the tissue morphology and immunophenotype of CLL. The IWCLL definition of SLL requires lymphadenopathy, no cytopenias due to BM infiltration by CLL/SLL and <5x109/L PB B-cells.\n",

It has specific clinical features by which it can be distinguished from acute GVHD. It may arise de novo but frequently follows acute GVHD. Less commonly, it occurs concurrently with acute GVHD. The earlier stages of chronic GVHD are characterised by a widespread lichenoid rash, poikiloderma and involvement of nails and oral mucous membranes. If the disease remains active, progressive sclerosis of the skin and deeper tissues may result in joint contractures, fibrosis of internal organs and severe malabsorption.\n",

Patients are normal at birth. Psychomotor delay becomes evident within 3 to 6 months with a delay in head support and sitting, hypotonia and athetoid movements. Sandy urine in diapers or crystalluria with urinary tract obstruction are common forms of presentation. Patients usually show mild to moderate intellectual deficit. Diagnosis is suspected when psychomotor delay occurs in a patient with elevated UA in blood and urine. Undetectable HPRT enzyme activity in peripheral blood or in intact cells (erythrocyte, fibroblast) and molecular genetic testing confirm the diagnosis. Inheritance is X-linked recessive.\n",

Moderate glucosuria has also been reported, but fructose absorption is normal. Glucose-galactose malabsorption is caused by a mutation in the SLC5A1 gene, encoding the glucose-sodium cotransporter, SGTL1. The mode of transmission is autosomal recessive. The fatal consequences of this syndrome can be avoided by following a glucose and galactose restricted diet.\n",

      "Congenital sucrase-isomaltase deficiency (CSID) is a carbohydrate intolerance disorder characterised by malabsorption of oligosaccharides and disaccharides. CSID is transmitted as an autosomal recessive trait and is caused by mutations in the brush-border membrane complex sucrase-isomaltase (SI), which is required for the breakdown of sucrose and starch into monosaccharides. The SI deficiency results in an accumulation of disaccharides in the lumen, causing osmotic diarrhoea. The prognosis for patients is good as the starch intolerance usually resolves during the first few years of life and sucrose intolerance usually improves with age.\n",

      "Alpha, alpha trehalase deficiency is characterised by diarrhoea and vomiting after ingestion of trehalose, a disaccharide found mainly in mushrooms. The disease is very rare in most populations but the incidence has been estimated at least 1 in 13 in Greenland. Isolated trehalose intolerance is due to a deficiency of trehalase (TREH; 11q23.3), a brush-border membrane glycoprotein.\n",

The familial form can be severe with early onset (abetalipoproteinemia/homozygous familial hypobetalipoproteinemia; see this term) or benign (benign familial hypobetalipoproteinemia; see this term). (Please add the sentence). Severe familial HBL and CMRD appear in infancy or childhood. As a result they are often associated with growth delay, diarrhoea with steatorrhoea, and fat malabsorption. Benign familial hypobetalipoproteinemia is generally asymptomatic, but in adults is occasionally associated with dietary intolerance to fat. HBL disorders are caused by mutations in proteins involved in the synthesis, secretion and catabolism of lipoproteins containing apolipoprotein B (LDL, VLDL and chylomicrons).\n",

All diagnostic requirements for PTSD are met.

The pattern of eating behaviour is not motivated by preoccupation with body weight or shape. Restricted food intake and its effects on weight, other aspects of health, or functioning are not due to unavailability of food, not a manifestation of another medical condition (e.g. food allergies, hyperthyroidism) or mental disorder, and are not due to the effect of a substance or medication on the central nervous system including withdrawal effects.\n",

      "Disorders due to use of sedatives, hypnotics or anxiolytics are characterised by the pattern and consequences of use of these substances. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics are typically prescribed for the short-term treatment of anxiety or insomnia and are also employed to provide sedation for medical procedures. They include the benzodiazepines and the non-benzodiazepine positive allosteric modulators of GABA receptors (i.e., ‘Z-drugs’) as well as many other compounds. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics include barbiturates, which are available much less commonly now than in previous decades. Sedatives, hypnotics, and anxiolytics have dependence-inducing properties that are related to the dose and duration of their use. They may cause intoxication, dependence and withdrawal. Several other mental disorders induced by sedatives, hypnotics, or anxiolytics are recognized.\n",

MDMA is methylene-dioxymethamphetamine and is a common drug of abuse in many countries especially among young people. It is predominantly available in tablet form known as ‘ecstasy’. Pharmacologically, MDMA has stimulant and empathogenic properties and these encourage its use among young people for social and other interactions. Considering its wide prevalence in many countries and among many sub-groups of young people, MDMA and Related Drug Dependence and MDMA and Related Drug Withdrawal are comparatively uncommon. Substance-Induced Mental Disorders may arise from its use. Several analogues of MDMA exist, including MDA (methylene-dioxyamphetamine).\n",

The daytime sleepiness is not better explained by another disorder (e.g., insufficient sleep syndrome, obstructive sleep apnoea, circadian rhythm sleep-wake disorder), a substance or medication, or a medical condition). Objective evidence of hypersomnolence is indicated by an MSLT showing a mean sleep latency of ≤ 8 minutes or by polysomnography or wrist actigraphy showing a total 24-hour sleep time of 11 hours or more. Prolonged and severe sleep inertia is often observed and consists of sustained difficulty waking up with repeated returns to sleep, irritability, automatic behaviour, and confusion.

      "Sinusitis is an inflammation of the mucosal lining of the paranasal sinuses secondary to both infectious and allergic mechanisms. The retention of sinus secretions is the most important event in the development of sinusitis. This creates a favourable milieu for the growth of infection agents and may be caused by the obstruction or narrowing of sinus ostia, mucociliary dysfunction and changes in mucus composition. 90% of sinus infections involve the maxillary sinus. Chronic sinusitis refers to symptom duration lasting 3 months or more. Diagnosis of sinusitis is based on past history and physical examination findings. The CT scan is the most sensitive technique in evaluating sinus disease. The goals of management of chronic sinusitis are to eradicate infection, to relieve ostiomeatal obstruction, to normalize mucociliary clearance, and to prevent complications. When pharmaceutical treatment does not have any remarkable improvement or when a surgical approach can be chosen as patient's complication, surgical intervention should be aimed to establish an effective sinus drainage from the ostium. Functional endoscopic sinus surgery (FESS) describes endoscopic techniques that have revolutionized the approach to sinus disease. The procedure is aimed at restoring the functional physiology of sinus aeration and drainage via the expanded ostiomeatal complex while minimizing surgical alteration of the normal anatomic pathways.\n",

Virtually any internal organ may be involved but the principle manifestations concern the breathing apparatus (chronic bronchitis), pancreas (pancreatic insufficiency, adolescent diabetes and occasionally pancreatitis) and, more rarely, the intestine (stercoral obstruction) or liver (cirrhosis). The usual presenting symptoms and signs include persistent pulmonary infection, pancreatic insufficiency, and elevated sweat chloride levels. However, many patients demonstrate mild or atypical symptoms, and clinicians should remain alert to the possibility of CF even when only a few of the usual features are present. Both criteria; clinical symptoms consistent with CF in at least one organ system and evidence of cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) dysfunction must be met to diagnose cystic fibrosis.\n",

It is thought to be due to spontaneous rupture of subpleural apical blebs or bullae that result from smoking or that are inherited. It generally occurs at rest, although some cases occur during activities involving reaching or stretching. Primary spontaneous pneumothorax also occurs during diving and high-altitude flying because of unequally transmitted pressure changes in the lung. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax occurs in patients with underlying pulmonary disease. It most often results from rupture of a bleb or bulla in patients with severe COPD, HIV-related Pneumocystis jirovecii infection, cystic fibrosis, or any underlying pulmonary parenchymal disease. Secondary spontaneous pneumothorax is more serious than primary spontaneous pneumothorax because it occurs in patients whose underlying lung disease decreases their pulmonary reserve.\n",

Although the disease may clear spontaneously in adolescence, there is a high risk of development of Human T-cell lymphotropic virus-associated myelopathy (tropical spastic paraparesis) in later life. The onset is most frequent between the ages of 2 and 3, but it can manifest from as early as a few months of age to late childhood.

There may be a greater affinity for the right hemi thorax, and the parenchyma is more commonly affected in the lower lobes. Macroscopically, the endometriotic implants appear as brown–yellow and sometimes red nodules surrounded by neovascularization. Symptoms include: dyspnea, shortness of breath, rapid heartbeat, coughing up blood and a variety of pain patterns to include scapula, chest, ipsilateral neck and shoulder, upper abdominal and epigastric. Thoracic endometriosis may present with catamenial pneumothorax (recurrent pneumothorax occurring within 72 hours of menstruation), haemoptysis in case of bronchial location, haemothorax, pericardial effusions. A diagnosis of thoracic endometriosis is simple when both endometrial stroma and gland are present. In cases of endometriosis with stroma only, a further classification of “aggregated pattern”, in which immunohistochemistry is ER-, PR- and CD10-positive might be necessary for diagnosis.\n",

Now thought to be due to chronic aristolochic acid ingestion (ingestion of Aristolochia clematitis seeds native to the Balkan region), though it has some differences from Chinese herbal nephropathy. This disease is characterised by renal insufficiency, proteinuria, tubulointerstitial nephritis, anaemia, weakness, copper discoloration of the skin, and may lead to end-stage renal disease within 5 years after onset.\n",

A small placenta is defined as a placenta that weighs less than the lower limit of normal for the gestational period. A low placental weight can be the result of a maternal or fetal conditions.

Infants with NDM do not produce enough insulin, leading to an increase in blood glucose. NDM can be mistaken for the much more common type 1 diabetes, but type 1 diabetes usually occurs later than the first 6 months of life. In about half of those with NDM, the condition is lifelong and is called permanent neonatal diabetes mellitus (PNDM). In the rest of those with NDM, the condition is transient and disappears during infancy but can reappear later in life; this type of NDM is called transient neonatal diabetes mellitus (TNDM).\n",

      "Hypocalcaemia is a common metabolic problem in newborns. In the neonate, hypocalcaemia is defined by birth weight (BW) categories. In infants with BW greater than 1500 g, hypocalcaemia is defined as a total serum calcium (Ca) concentration less than 8 mg/dL (2 mmol/L) or an ionized fraction of less than 4.4 mg/dL (1.1 mmol/L). In very low birth weight premature infants (BW<1500 g), hypocalcaemia is defined as a total serum Ca concentration less than 7 mg/dL (1.75 mmol/L) or an ionized fraction of less than 4 mg/dL (1 mmol/L). Aetiologies of early hypocalcaemia (occurs in the first two to three days after birth) include prematurity, maternal diabetes, birth asphyxia, and intrauterine growth. Causes of late hypocalcaemia (usually occurs at the end of the first week of life) include hypoparathyroidism and high phosphate intake. Most infants with hypocalcaemia are asymptomatic. If symptomatic, neuromuscular irritability is the most common sign with jitteriness and muscle jerking. Less common findings include seizures, and rarely laryngospasm, wheezing, or vomiting.\n",

The major cause is inadequate intake of calcium and phosphorus to meet the requirements for growth. Poor intake of vitamin D is an additional risk factor. Contributing factors include prolonged parenteral nutrition, vitamin D and calcium malabsorption, intake of unsupplemented human milk, immobilization, and urinary calcium losses from long-term diuretic use.\n",

The entire colon, small intestine, stomach, and oesophagus may also be affected. Most infants are premature or suffer from respiratory distress syndrome, sepsis, or hypoxia. Symptoms (apparent during the first few weeks of life) include abdominal distension, bilious vomiting, and melaena; there may be apnoea, lethargy, temperature instability, tachycardia, tachypnoea, and a fall in blood pressure.

Other lesions which sometimes may be considered to be a functionally univentricular heart include complex forms of atrioventricular septal defect, double outlet right ventricle, congenitally corrected transposition, pulmonary atresia with intact ventricular septum, and other cardiovascular malformations. Specific diagnostic codes should be used whenever possible, and not the term “functionally univentricular heart”.\n",

Subaortic obstruction can be caused by different lesions: subaortic membrane or tunnel, accessory mitral valve tissue, abnormal insertion of the mitral anterior leaflet to the ventricular septum, deviation of the outlet septum (seen in coarctation of the aorta and interrupted aortic arch), or a restrictive ventricular septal defect (bulboventricular foramen) in single ventricle complexes. Subvalvar aortic stenosis may be categorized into two types: localised subvalvar aortic stenosis, which consists of a fibrous or fibromuscular ridge, and diffuse tunnel subvalvar aortic stenosis, in which circumferential narrowing commences at the annular level and extends downward for 1-3 cm.\n",

They occur in approximately 1 in 5000 live births. These comprise a wide spectrum of diseases, which can affect boys and girls, and involve the distal anus and rectum as well as the urinary and genital tracts. Several abnormalities can occur, including the following: A membrane may be present over the anal opening; The rectum may not connect to the anus (imperforate anus); The rectum may connect to a part of the urinary tract or the reproductive system through an abnormal passage called a fistula. The classification of ARMs is mainly based on the position of the rectal pouch relative to the puborectal sling, the presence or absence of fistulas, and the types and locations of the fistulas. The following classification is according to the level of the atretic rectal cul-de-sac with respect to the pubococcygeal line (the radiological landmark for the upper border or the levator ani muscle).\n",

The drug is a synthetic nonsteroidal oestrogen, used in the US until 1971 and in Europe until 1978 to try and prevent miscarriage, premature delivery, and other pregnancy complications. It has been estimated that 25% of female fetuses exposed to DES in utero during the first trimester have subsequently developed genital tract anomalies including vaginal adenosis, cervical malformations, vaginal septae, uterine cavity anomalies, or fallopian tube anomalies causing subsequent fertility problems.\n",

A characteristic pattern of facial dysmorphism is frequently present, especially notable in early childhood. Neurodevelopmental problems including reduced IQ, poorer language and motor development, increased rates of autistic spectrum disorder and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder are observed in up to 40% of those exposed. Vision problems such as myopia and astigmatism are also common.

      "Sudden unexpected death in epilepsy (SUDEP) is a category of death in people with epilepsy that occurs under benign circumstances and in the absence of known structural causes of death (i.e. not due to drowning, injury, intoxication and other internal or external factors). Evidence of a preceding seizure may be present or not. A “definite SUDEP” is confirmed if a postmortem examination does not reveal an alternative cause of death. If such examination lacks, but potentially lethal alternative causes are excluded and all other criteria are met, the death is labelled as “probable SUDEP”. The term “possible SUDEP” is used in cases with competing causes of death or when data are insufficient to reasonably allow their classification. The term “SUDEP plus” applies when a patient also suffered from other diseases that may have contributed to the death, but there are no clues that the alternative condition has truly caused it. Cases in which cardiopulmonary resuscitation prevented the death are called “near-SUDEP”.\n",
