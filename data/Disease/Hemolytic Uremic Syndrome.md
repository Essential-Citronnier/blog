# Hemolytic Uremic Syndrome (HUS)

- **Symptoms**: Hemolytic anemia, thrombocytopenia, acute kidney injury, often following E. coli infection.
- **Diagnostics**: Schistocytes on blood smear, elevated reticulocyte count, and renal failure markers (increased BUN, creatinine).
- **Treatment**: Supportive care, including dialysis in severe cases, and careful monitoring of kidney function.

**Key Learning Point**: Early recognition of HUS is critical due to the risk of severe renal failure and long-term complications.
