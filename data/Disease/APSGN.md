# Acute Poststreptococcal Glomerulonephritis (APSGN)

- **Symptoms**: Sudden onset of hematuria, edema, and hypertension following a sore throat or skin infection.
- **Diagnostics**: Elevated ASO titers, low C3 levels, and kidney biopsy showing characteristic glomerular changes.
- **Treatment**: Blood pressure control with calcium channel blockers (Nifedipine) and careful monitoring for complications like hypertensive encephalopathy.

**Key Learning Point**: APSGN presents with volume overload and decreased GFR, requiring prompt management of hypertension to prevent further complications.
