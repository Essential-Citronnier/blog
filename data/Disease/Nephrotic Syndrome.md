# Nephrotic Syndrome (신증후군)

- **Symptoms**: Edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipidemia, and massive proteinuria.
- **Diagnostic Features**: Elevated cholesterol levels, reduced albumin, significant protein loss in urine (up to 8,500 mg/24 hr).
- **Treatment**: Steroids (Prednisolone), monitoring for complications like infections and thrombosis due to hypoalbuminemia.

**Key Learning Point**: Nephrotic syndrome increases the risk of thromboembolism, especially in children. Avoid aggressive hydration due to the risk of exacerbating edema.
